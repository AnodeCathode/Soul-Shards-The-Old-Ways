Version 2.2.0
------------------------------------------------------

- Moved multiblock recipe to JSON format
  - The X, Y, and Z are an offset from the block the player right clicked
  - Limitations:
    - There must be an origin block at 0, 0, 0.
    - The origin block must be the one to be right clicked. You cannot completely surround it by other blocks.
- Added a description to JEI for the Soul Shard
- Removed all references to the Soul Forge in code. It's just a machine that will be used once then never again. Sticking with the in-world creation.

------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.1.3
------------------------------------------------------

- Moved Shard configs to a JSON system
  - Much cleaner code wise
  - Less prone to errors
  - Allows for custom tiers to be created
    - Requires custom resources for textures and models. Works fine without these, however.
- Fixed bug where an MCP name was called in an obfuscated environment.
- [API] Added ISoulShard for instanceof checks. Currently no use other than that. May expand to have getters

------------------------------------------------------
