------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.3.2
------------------------------------------------------

- Fixed some misunderstandings about block updates
- Changed checking of light level to the location the entity will spawn at instead of the cage's location
- Re-balance to place Shard creation just after entering the Nether.
  - Replaced End Stone with Quartz Block
  - For existing instances, delete `../config/sstow/Multiblock.json` to get the change.

------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.3.1
------------------------------------------------------

- Re-enabled the JEI plugin
- Moved to official Forge builds instead of the bootleg ones I was using
- Re-added the anti-boss config
  - Shards for bosses can still be obtained, but they will not spawn.
- Fixed Shard being unobtainable in Survival
  - Left click on the origin block with a Diamond instead of right click.
  - PlayerInteractEvent is currently broken as the system that powers it is being re-done. Until then, left click!

------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.3.0
------------------------------------------------------

- Initial pre-release for Minecraft 1.9. You still need to wait for Forge to release builds.
  - Spawning is a bit... iffy. You'll see if you try it. Not sure if it's my fault or Forge's.
  - Direct port. No major changes. Worlds should move just fine.
  - All compatibility has been disabled for now.

------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.2.7
------------------------------------------------------

- Added compatibility with Blood Magic
  - Allows requiring use of LP in order for the Soul Cage to function.
  - Defaults to 250 LP required *per mob* on an individual basis. This means that it will only spawn the amount of mobs available from your current LP count.
  - Causes a nausea effect when not enough LP is available and the cage is activated. Disallows spawning.
- Config to disallow Cage Born mobs from counting towards Shard kill count
- [API] CageSpawnEvent now obtains it's tier value from the Shard instead of manually passing it. Shouldn't affect anybody.

------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------

- Fix Wither Skeletons not counting kills after a shard was set to one (#8)

------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------

- Fix spawn cap

------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.2.4
------------------------------------------------------

- Added German translation
- Cleaned up some Skeleton special casing
- Removed Villager special casing. Standard method works just fine for them
- Reworked the Soul Cage spawning mechanic to be less... silly
- Fixed another instance of hardcoding to 5.
- [API] Added a ShardTierChangeEvent that fires when a Shard's tier changes through normal means.
- [API] Added a CageSpawnEvent (Cancellable) that fires right before a Soul Cage is about to spawn an entity

------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.2.3
------------------------------------------------------

- Fixed a few instances of hardcoding to a max of 5 tiers
- Added a durability bar to Shards to display how close to max tier it is.

------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.2.1
------------------------------------------------------

- Fixed third person models for items. They no longer look like a held tool.
- Added Vile Dust and made some recipe tweaks to account for it.
- Added config option to change the cooldown time to be considered in ticks instead of seconds. Useful for those who want finer control over timings.

------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.2.0
------------------------------------------------------

- Moved multiblock recipe to JSON format
  - The X, Y, and Z are an offset from the block the player right clicked
  - Limitations:
    - There must be an origin block at 0, 0, 0.
    - The origin block must be the one to be right clicked. You cannot completely surround it by other blocks.
- Added a description to JEI for the Soul Shard
- Removed all references to the Soul Forge in code. It's just a machine that will be used once then never again. Sticking with the in-world creation.

------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.1.3
------------------------------------------------------

- Moved Shard configs to a JSON system
  - Much cleaner code wise
  - Less prone to errors
  - Allows for custom tiers to be created
    - Requires custom resources for textures and models. Works fine without these, however.
- Fixed bug where an MCP name was called in an obfuscated environment.
- [API] Added ISoulShard for instanceof checks. Currently no use other than that. May expand to have getters

------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.1.2
------------------------------------------------------

- Config to require the owner to be online for the cage to work. Owner = Person who put shard in cage.
- Config to disable XP drops from spawned entities.
- New textures. Completely re-textured by BBoldt to be thematically similar to the original.
